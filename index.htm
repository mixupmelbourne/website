											Unfortunately, Mixup Melbourne was not able to secure its regular venue,
											and we were unable to find a venue within budget that met our four most
											important needs.
										</p>
										<p>
											We had to make the very hard decision to go with the
											wheelchair inaccessible venue that offered a <em>non-corporate environment</em> with
											suitable <em>presentation facilities</em> and the ability to uphold our Code of
											Conduct through securing <em>exclusive access to the entire venue</em>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Given the
											short notice period we had to find an alternative venue, our only other
											consideration was to cancel the event. We will be working earlier on to
											secure a more suitable venue for 2019, and offer our sincerest apologies to
											those for whom this makes the event inaccessible.

					<h3>Be Inspired</h3>
					<p>
						Mixup kicks off this year with what we're calling <b>The Last Talk of the Year</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sarah Spencer (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/HeartOfPluto_">Heart of Pluto</a>) has become
						known for her beautiful integration of art and technology. Sarah has paired a knitting machine
						with electronics and programming to produce everything from scarves to a knitted map of the
						night sky.
					</p>
					<p>
						In <b>The Last Talk of the Year</b>, Sarah will be talking about the technology behind the 
						knitting printer and will show off her machine. Be sure to join us in the upstairs library 
						from 7pm to end the year inspired and excited for 2019.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>

                  <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination, related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or any other personal characteristic;</li>

                  <h2>Enforcement</h2>
                  <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
                  <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event.</p>
                  <p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.</p>
                  <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!</p>
                  <h2>Reporting</h2>
                  <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to a meetup organiser. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our events for everyone. We want you to be happy at our events. People like you make our events a better place.</p>
                  <p>You can make a report either personally or anonymously.</p>

                  <p>We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.</p>
                  <h3>Personal Report</h3>
